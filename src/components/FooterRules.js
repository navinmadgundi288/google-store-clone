              <li> <h6 className='lit10'> Compared to Pixel 6 which was launched in the US (Pixel 6 was not launched in India). Speed and power efficiency claims based on internal testing on pre-production devices. </h6></li>
              <li> <h6 className='lit11'> Measured diagonally; dimension may vary by configuration and manufacturing process.</h6> </li>
              <li> <h6 className='lit12'> Not available for all apps or content. </h6> </li>
              <li> <h6 className='lit13'> HDR brightness measured at 100% on-pixel ratio. Peak brightness measured at 5% on-pixel ratio. </h6> </li>
              <li> <h6 className='lit14'> Dimensions and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process. </h6> </li>
              <li> <h6 className='lit15'> For '24-hour': Estimated battery life based on testing using a median Pixel user battery usage profile across a mix of talk, data, standby and use of other features. Average battery life during testing was approximately 31 hours. Battery testing conducted on a major operator network. For 'Up to 72-hour': Estimated battery life based on testing using a median Pixel user battery usage profile across a mix of talk, data, standby and use of limited other features that are default in Extreme Battery Saver mode (which disables various features including 5G connectivity). Battery testing conducted on a major operator network. For both claims: Battery testing conducted in California in mid-2022 on pre-production hardware and software using default settings, except that, for the 'Up to 72-hour' claim only, Extreme Battery Saver mode was enabled. Battery life depends upon many factors and usage of certain features will decrease battery life. Actual battery life may be lower.</h6> </li>
              <li> <h6 className='lit16'> Estimate of typical capacity based upon testing and expected mobile behaviour. </h6> </li>
              <li> <h6 className='lit17'> Fast wired charging rates (up to 20W on Pixel 7 and up to 23W on Pixel 7 Pro) are based upon use of the Google 30W USB-C® Charger plugged into a wall socket. Actual results may be slower. Adapters sold separately. Charging speed based upon testing with device batteries drained to 1% and charged with Google 30W USB-C® Charger. Charging testing conducted by Google in mid-2022 on pre-production hardware and software using default settings with the device powered on. Charging speed depends upon many factors including usage during charging, battery age and ambient temperature. Actual charging speed may be slower. </h6> </li>
              <li> <h6 className='lit18'> Wireless charging rates up to 20W (Pixel 7) and up to 23W (Pixel 7 Pro) charging with Google Pixel Stand (2nd gen) (sold separately). Up to 12W with Qi-certified EPP chargers (sold separately). Actual results may be slower. </h6> </li>
              <li> <h6 className='lit19'> Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro work on most major operator networks. Contact operator for details. Mobile service and band support are operator dependent and not available in all areas. Some bands supported by the device hardware may not be enabled. See g.co/pixel/networkinfo for details. </h6></li>
              <li> <h6 className='lit20'> Requires a 5G data plan (sold separately). 5G service not available on all operator networks or in all areas. Contact operator for details. 5G service, speed and performance depend on many factors, including operator network capabilities and signal strength. Actual results may vary. Some features not available in all areas. Data rates may apply. See g.co/pixel/networkinfo for info. </h6></li>
              <li> <h6 className='lit21'> Pixel security updates for at least five years from when the device first became available on the Google Store in the US. Updates may also include feature drops and other software updates. See g.co/pixel/updates for more information. </h6></li>
              <li> <h6 className='lit22'> Designed to comply with dust and water protection rating IP68 under IEC standard 60529 when each device leaves the factory, but device is not water or dustproof. The accessories are not water or dust resistant. Water and dust resistance are not permanent conditions, and diminishes or is lost over time due to normal wear and tear, device repair, disassembly or damage. Dropping your device may result in loss of water/dust resistance. Liquid damage voids the warranty. See g.co/pixel/water. </h6></li>
              <li> <h6 className='lit23'> Google's devices meet the hearing aid compatibility (HAC) requirements set by the FCC. See g.co/pixel/hac. </h6></li>
